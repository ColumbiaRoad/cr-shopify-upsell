## Extension visibility 
By default after install the extension will be disabled, the user has to explicitly enable it on the admin app. So if you don't see it while developing, make sure you look the status in the admin app first.

## Code hygiene
- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for all your commits
